# TravelBag Project

I completed this project as part of the ByteGrad NextJs and React course. The tech stack includes JavaScript, React and Tailwind CSS.

The travel bag app allows you to create a list of items you need to pack for travel and mark them off as you pack them.

Features include: 
- Adding and removing items from  your list
- Marking items as unpacked or packed
- Sorting your item list
- Removing all items

I have launched the application on Vercel and you can interact with it here - https://travelbag-project.vercel.app/
